/**
 * A JVM-specific implementation of [FilePersistencyStorageProvider] for managing agent checkpoints
 * in a file system.
 *
 * This class utilizes JVM's [Path] for file system operations and [JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite]
 * for file system access. It organizes checkpoints by agent ID in a structured directory format
 * under the specified root directory.
 *
 * Use this class to persistently store and retrieve agent checkpoints to and from a file-based system
 * in JVM environments.
 *
 * @constructor Initializes the [JVMFilePersistencyStorageProvider] with a specified root directory [root].
 * @param root The root directory where all agent checkpoints will be stored.
